## Quick Start (Deploy on Render)

### 1. Fork & Clone
Push both `backend` and `frontend` folders to your GitHub repo.

### 2. Deploy Backend
- Go to [Render](https://render.com/), create a new Web Service, and connect your repo.
- Set the root directory to `backend`.
- Set environment variables (see `.env.example` in `backend/`).
- **Important:** Set `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI` to your Render backend URL (e.g., `https://sonicmirror-backend.onrender.com/auth/callback`).
- Set `FRONTEND_URI` to your frontend Render URL (e.g., `https://sonicmirror-frontend.onrender.com/dashboard`).
- Add your backend `/auth/callback` URL to your Spotify Developer Dashboard as a redirect URI.

### 3. Deploy Frontend
- Create a new Static Site (or Web Service for SSR) on Render, set root to `frontend`.
- No special environment variables needed for static export.
- All API calls are already set to use your backend Render URL.

### 4. Configure Spotify
- Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).
- Add your backend `/auth/callback` Render URL as a redirect URI.
- Use your client ID and secret in the backend environment variables.

### 5. Environment Variables
See `backend/.env` for all required variables. 

### 6. Usage
- Visit your frontend Render URL.
- Log in with Spotify.
- Enjoy your AI-powered stats, roasts, and recommendations!

## Security Notes
- All tokens are handled securely for MVP. For production, consider moving to HTTP-only cookies.
- Never commit your real `.env` file or secrets to GitHub.
